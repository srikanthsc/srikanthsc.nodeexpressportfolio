My own personal website.
### Introduction
Greetings and thank you for exploring my personal website! This platform is a product of my dedication and creativity, built entirely from the ground up. Employing the Node.js framework, with Express.js layered on top, I manage the server. The server adapts to listen on PROCESS.ENV.PORT when hosted on Heroku or localhost:8888 when executed locally from my home setup. Noteworthy, the website embraces server-side rendering, eliminating the need for client connections to execute scripts for page loading. The frontend is meticulously crafted using Pug, a template language formerly known as Jade.
### Insights into Pug
In essence, I perceive Pug as HTML with Python indentation rules blended with JavaScript. It serves the purpose of creating template pages, each capable of drawing upon different pieces of information. This is achieved through the iteration of JSON strings passed to Pug's render method. Pug supports embedded JavaScript, enabling the use of variables, control flow, methods, and more. These elements are seamlessly removed from the HTML source when sent to the client, ensuring a clean and script-free appearance, particularly suitable for a static site like this. Importantly, Pug allows me to manage a single post template and, at the current stage, six markdown files, streamlining the handling of boilerplate information.
